# wcms-percussion-publishing-tasks

These scripts are used as Rhythmyx post-publishing tasks.  At the end of a sucessful publishing run, these scripts are invoked to
copy content from the publishing folder (where Rhythmyx put it) to the content folder (where the
[Content Delivery Engine](https://github.com/NCIOCPL/wcms-cde) can access it).
